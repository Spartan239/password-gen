Password generator


This is a simple, java based password generator I developed in a short period of time. It generates a random password from information you give it (how many letters, numbers and symbols you want).

* Allows you to customise how many letters, symbols and numbers you want, determining the length of the password
* Everything is randomised
* Includes all letters (a-z A-Z), numbers (0-9) and a handful of symbols (hand picked to not interfere with programs, such as \ and % being excluded)
* Can be up to 40 letters in length (by default, tinkering with the code can allow more ;) )

Enjoy!
